Very Simple Library

A simple library book management software. There are three models, `Book`, `Library`  and `Lend` in the models folder.
The program allows the user to upload the books to a certian library. It can tell the user when a book was taken out and when it is due.
If the book is late it can calculate the late fee according to a library's penalty fee.
